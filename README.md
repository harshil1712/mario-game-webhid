# Mario Game - WebHID Demo

A small Mario game that shows the implementation of the [WebHID API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebHID_API).

The Game is configured to works with only a DualSense 5 Controller.

If you want to add support for other controllers, feel free to open up a [pull request](https://github.com/harshil1712/webhid-demo-html/pulls).
